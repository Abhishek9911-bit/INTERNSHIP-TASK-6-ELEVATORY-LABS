Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools
Password Strength Analysis Project
Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength
Cybersecurity Internship Project by Sankabathula Abhishek

Overview
This project analyzes password strength using PasswordMeter.com to evaluate three different passwords and understand security fundamentals.

Key Findings
Password length is the most critical factor determining strength

Character diversity across all four types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) significantly improves security

Consecutive patterns and predictable sequences substantially reduce password effectiveness

A 13-character password with mixed character types achieved maximum security rating

Test Results
Password 1: "abc123#" - Score: 44% (Good)
Length: 7 characters

Composition: Lowercase letters, numbers, symbols

Missing: Uppercase letters

Crack Time: ~2 hours

Vulnerability: High - predictable patterns (abc, 123)

Password 2: "Temp$2024" - Score: 70% (Strong)
Length: 9 characters

Composition: All four character types

Crack Time: ~3 years

Vulnerability: Medium - contains dictionary word "Temp"

Password 3: "SecStr0ng#2024" - Score: 100% (Very Strong)
Length: 13 characters

Composition: All four character types with high entropy

Crack Time: ~150,000 years

Vulnerability: Low-Medium - strong resistance to most attacks

Security Recommendations
Immediate Guidelines
Minimum Length: 12+ characters

Character Diversity: Use all four character types

Avoid Patterns: No consecutive sequences (abc, 123)

No Dictionary Words: Avoid common words and simple modifications

Unique Passwords: Different password for each account

Advanced Security Measures
Use password managers for generation and storage

Enable multi-factor authentication

Consider passphrase methodology

Implement breach monitoring

Regular security awareness
